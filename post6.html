                    <p>Until now our blogs dealt with macroscale Environmental issues; we talked about Bitcoin,
                        Water distribution, Population, and so on … But hey ! one need not need travel to Detroit or
                        Hebei to write a thesis on AQI. As they say “look at your backyard before criticizing others”
                        or in a poetic sense “ There is nothing quite so delightfully mysterious as a secret in your
                        own backyard”, so we literally chose to peep at the “backyard” of our campus. We are going
                        to analytically peruse the environmental impact of the Panki Thermal Power Station which
                        can be seen from the terrace of Hall13, IITK.
                    </p>

                    <p>Panki Thermal Power Station, located at Panki in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, was commissioned
                        in 1967 by the then Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi.

                    </p>

                    <p>The plant has gone through three stages.
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The 1st stage had two units of 32 Mega Watts each, and it began operation in 1967
                            both the units ceased operations in 1998.

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The 2nd stage had two units of 110 Mega Watts each and started the process in
                            1977 with the machinery from Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited. The second stage
                            ceased operations in 2018.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The Third Stage is under construction. It will have one unit of 660 Mega Watts. Its
                            foundation stone was laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2019 and is expected to
                            be completed by the end of Jan 2022 and start operating by the end of 2022.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>In 2010 UPPCB recommended the closure of Panki Thermal Power Plant for defying the air
                        and water pollution norms. The action was initiated after local complaints that they were
                        getting respiratory problems and that the ash from the station was flying in their houses.
                    </p>

                    <p>According to UPPCB officials, the adverse impact on vegetation and respiratory problems in
                        humans increased in colonies near Panki industrial area due to an unabated increase in
                        SPM(suspended particulate matter) and ash in the surrounding area.
                        After the warning from the UPPCB authorities, the thermal power station has submitted a
                        14.16 cr project, and locals got relief. Hence, UPPCB decided to cancel its closure order, but
                        finally, in 2018, they closed it.
                    </p>

                    <p>Traditionally uncontrolled emission from poorly managed thermal power plants in northern
                        and eastern India has been the primary source for the haze that envelops the Indo-Gangetic
                        plains during winter. The winter haze seriously compromises the health of millions of the
                        region and drastically reduces crop yield, and has various other non-perceived effects. India
                        has about 90 coal-based power plants with a capacity greater than 100 MW, of which a large
                        number are located in the Ganga basin. These plants use thousands of tonnes of low-grade
                        coal (with 30-45 percent ash content) daily, which is the primary source of emission of carbon
                        dioxide and other pollutants such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and hydrocarbons,
                        lead to the formation of ozone close to the earth’s surface.
                    </p>

                    <p>In 2006 in a study by IITK,
                        researchers Anup Prasad and Ramesh Singh with Menas Kafatos of the George Mason
                        University in the US measured the concentration of aerosols (fine particles like black carbon
                        and sulfates) over the region using satellite data. They found that the aerosol concentration
                        over the thermal plants was much higher than their immediate surroundings. They found that
                        in the case of the 240 MW Panki plant in Uttar Pradesh, the aerosol concentration was 15
                        percent higher than in its surroundings, including the highly-polluted Kanpur city.
                    </p>

                    <p>Though in “paper” thermal power plants are equipped with electrostatic precipitator filters to
                        reduce emissions, we are not sure if they are checked or replaced regularly. Using alternate
                        technology like geo-polymer-based technology for utilization of fly ash such as road-making,
                        etc. and better governmental policy such as heavily subsidizing Electrostatic filters and other
                        such devices could greatly reduce the emission levels.                        
                    </p>

                    <p>With meteorological data indicating that the duration and thickness of the winter haze is
                        increasing over the last 50 years in this region, the decision for expansion of the Panki
                        Thermal Power Plant will definitely have a negative impact on the local environment,
                        including the IIT Kanpur campus area. The EAC in 2016 had also said that the local
                        population is opposed to the idea of a new power plant, as the 220MW unit was releasing a
                        significant amount of ash, causing environmental damage and health problems. The new
                        660MW plant, with triple the capacity of the old one and would certainly add to the
                        displeasure of the locals.
                        
                    </p>

                    <p>The case of the Panki Power plant represents a perfect example of the Pollution vs Politics
                        conflict and can also be a topic of a classic Utilitarian debate - “Should one prefer the
                        greatest good of greatest number over the good of minority ?”.
                    </p>

                    <p>In politics especially in a democratic country often Popular sentiments guide the
                        policy-making mechanism. Hard facts are often pushed down under the carpet to cater to the
                        public ego. As a science-backed group, overtly concerned with the Environment, we believe
                        that policies as well as politics should back nature first as any damage done to the
                        Environment is irreparable and certainly adds to the distress of the people at large.
                    </p>
